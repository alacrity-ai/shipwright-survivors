# 🚀 ShipForge: Space Survival

A block-based space survival game where you build ships, collect resources, and battle waves of enemies.

## 🎮 Game Overview

ShipForge combines the addictive wave-based combat of games like Vampire Survivors with deep ship customization and resource management:

- **Block-Based Ship Building**: Construct your ship from modular blocks, each with unique properties
- **Resource Collection**: Gather currency from defeated enemies to upgrade your ship
- **Wave-Based Combat**: Battle increasingly difficult waves of enemy ships
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Navigate with realistic inertial movement and thruster effects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** for type-safe code
- **React + Vite** for UI and build system
- **Canvas API** for rendering game elements
- **Entity-Component System** for game architecture

## 🎮 How to Play

- **WASD**: Thrust and movement
- **Mouse**: Aim weapons
- **Left Click**: Fire primary weapons
- **Tab**: Open ship builder
- **Space**: Rotate block (in ship builder)
- **Left Click**: Place block (in ship builder)
- **Right Click**: Remove block (in ship builder)

## 🧠 Key Systems

### Ship Building

Ships are constructed from a grid of discrete blocks placed relative to a central cockpit. Each block type has unique properties (armor, cost, behavior) and is procedurally rendered.

### Intent System

The game uses an intent-based control system that decouples input from execution. This allows both player and AI ships to use the same underlying systems for movement and combat.

### AI Behavior

Enemy ships use a finite state machine with states like Patrol, Attack, and Flee. The AI makes decisions based on proximity, health, and tactical considerations.

### Physics

The game features Newtonian physics with inertia and realistic thruster effects. Ships must manage momentum and rotation to navigate effectively.
