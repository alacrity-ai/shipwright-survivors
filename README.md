## üéÆ Game Overview

Shipwright Survivors (SWS) combines the addictive wave-based combat of games like Vampire Survivors with deep ship customization and resource management:

- **Block-Based Ship Building**: Construct your ship from modular blocks, each with unique properties
- **Resource Collection**: Gather currency from defeated enemies to upgrade your ship
- **Wave-Based Combat**: Battle increasingly difficult waves of enemy ships
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Navigate with realistic inertial movement and thruster effects

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** for type-safe code
- **React + Vite** for UI and build system
- **Canvas API** for rendering game elements
- **Entity-Component System** for game architecture

## üß† Key Systems

### Ship Building

Ships are constructed from a grid of discrete blocks placed relative to a central cockpit. Each block type has unique properties (armor, cost, behavior) and is procedurally rendered.

### Intent System

The game uses an intent-based control system that decouples input from execution. This allows both player and AI ships to use the same underlying systems for movement and combat.

### AI Behavior

Enemy ships use a finite state machine with states like Patrol, Attack, and Flee. The AI makes decisions based on proximity, health, and tactical considerations.

### Physics

The game features Newtonian physics with inertia and realistic thruster effects. Ships must manage momentum and rotation to navigate effectively.

  - [ ] Add a second instance of postprocessing layer that is always on passthrough except during sepia after mission.
  - [ ] On starting mission, little flash sting thing (think megaman).  Play a tiny tune. Then sound effect as the words disperse, then song starts.

    - [ ] Basic description when hovered
    - [ ] Additional Descriptions when Selected
      - [ ] Description box of objectives / Unlockables
      - [ ] Alternate mission arrows with a (. . . (.) . .) tab selector at bottom.

    - [ ] Make player cockpits specific: cockpitPlayer0, cockpitPlayer1, etc.
  - [ ] Screen edge indicators (e.g. showing objectives on the map, minibosses, etc): compliments radar
  - [ ] Make enemy wave spawn notifications more gameified and obvious. Big warning center screen + sounds, blinking countdown, and perhaps notifications when wave spawner is paused, e.g. in an event.
  - [x] Lots of Random Events things to discover in a run:
    - [ ] Enemy Spawner: When triggered, spawns a bunch of enemies, destroying it gives reward

      - [ ] Starter ship 2: Projectiles only fire forward
      - [ ] Starter ship 3: Turrets have 20% more damage
  - [ ] Add settings menu to the titlescreen
  - [ ] Multilingual support, use this technique:
      ``` 
      import { tr } from '@/i18n/template';

      {
        type: 'line',
        speakerId: 'carl',
        text: tr`intro-briefing.line1|Greetings, Shipwright Second Class. Assessing your consciousness status...`,
      }
      ``` And then keep the other language definitions for intro-briefing.line1 in another file
      - [ ] Also allow Quitting directly from this menu if we're in electron
  - [ ] Add click-to-move movement option (Instead of WASD)
  - [ ] Improve initial mission tutorial:
    - [ ] Handle block rotation, refinement, autoplace, and place explicitly (Lock buttons if needed, give blocks if needed)
    - [ ] Handle incident interaction, e.g. where spending entropium is a thing. Maybe a merchant incident.
    - [ ] Make better first boss.
BUGS:
  - [ ] If you levelup, and then get enough EXP for another levelup during the delay (before the levelup window pops up), you lose the powerup choice from the first levelup.  We need to queue all the levelups to make sure you get all the choices. This can be easy, just keep track of total powerups, and if you don't have as many as you do levels, then reopen the menu on close.
  - [ ] Changing resolution in game from a small resolution to a large messes up the background, I think we need to reinstantiate or cleanup the background renderer/system.  Maybe the image in the image cache as well.
  - [ ] Post processing layer not properly invalidating on Resolution change (bloom is blurry on change)
  - [ ] Disabling Lighting in settings menu needs to clear lighting canvas
  - [ ] Enemy turrets aim toward mouse location.  Only player ship should do that, enemy turrets should aim where they are facing.

### Things to Explore:
  - [ ] "Town Portal" - Back to the planet? 
  - [ ] Add autofire option?
