# Enemy Ideas

## Basic Enemy Types

Minimirrors - A floating cockpit, which if given time to scan, transforms into the player's ship. (1 tier lower on all blocks for balance?)

Grapplers - Attach to player with a grappling hook, pull themselves into melee range, and then spam guns

Detonators - Fly toward the player and explode when within range (after a short fuse delay)

Trappers (Pending block collisions) - Fly into range of player, then build a prison of blocks around the player

Laser spinners (Spin in circles while firing lasers in every direction)

Megastations - Sprawling space stations with many arms that you need to fly through to find the cockpit

Rammers (Pending block collisions) - Small ships with facetplates that ram into the player

Carriers - Large ships that spawn smaller ships to attack the player

Medics - Ships that repair themselves and other nearby enemies

Shielders - Ships that build shields around themselves and other nearby enemies
